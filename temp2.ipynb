    "### Match by similar transaction activity\n",
    "\n",
    "The following approaches are in discussion: - Looking at the distributions above extract the amount of history a buyer most likely has at the issue data of the card - For each non buyer, find a buyer which was active in a similar time window (Jaccard similarity on the Year-Month sets)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NEW IDEA\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking at the full activity of a buyer, we only look at the pre-purchase activity as there is reason to believe that clients may change their patterns after purchasing date and therefore add unwanted bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./docs/IMG_BBEF82A6C6B5-1.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focus on Contextual Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to setting artificial card issue date for non-cardholders goes beyond simple feature matching. We concentrate on the periods during which clients engage with the bank in the form of transactions. This method assumes that clients active during similar periods might be influenced by the same economic and societal conditions, providing a more nuanced foundation for establishing connections between current cardholders and potential new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process emphasizes matching based on the timing of activity, rather than a wide array of characteristics. By identifying when both existing cardholders and non-cardholders interacted with the bank, we can infer a level of behavioral alignment that extends beyond mere transactional data. This alignment suggests a shared response to external conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanism of Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Our matching utilizes the Jaccard similarity index to compare activity patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Activity Comparison**: We compare a vector representing an existing cardholder's monthly activity against a matrix of non-cardholders' activity patterns. Here we only consider the activity from the first transaction period across all customers to the card issue date.\n",
    "-   **Use of Jaccard Index**: This metric helps us quantify the resemblance between the activity patterns, focusing on the occurrence of activity rather than its volume, to identify meaningful parallels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eligibility and Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential matches are subjected to specific criteria to ensure alignment for later model construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Account History**: Non-cardholders must have an established history of interaction, with at least 25 months of history between account creation and card issuance (12 months = period as a new customer + 13 months = one year of history + 1 month lag).\n",
    "2.  **Period of Activity**: The analysis considers activities up to the card issuance date of the cardholder, aligning potential non-cardholders based on their response to similar conditions.\n",
    "3.  **Selection Process**: From the non-cardholders with high similarity scores, one is randomly selected from the top-N candidates to maintain fairness in the matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective of the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "This matching strategy is designed to identify potential cardholders whose historical interaction patterns suggest a fit with card holders. The focus on specific periods of engagement, backed by eligibility criteria and a fair selection process, ensures that new additions to our cardholder base share a commonality that goes beyond surface-level similarities without searching a direct twin for each card holder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Construction of the Activity Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The activity matrix serves as the foundation of our matching process, mapping out the engagement of clients with our services over time. It is constructed from transaction data, organizing client interactions into a structured format that highlights periods of activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Aggregation**: We start with transaction data, which records each client's interactions across various months. This data includes every transaction made by both current cardholders and potential non-cardholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Temporal Transformation**: Each transaction is associated with a specific date. These dates are then transformed into monthly periods, consolidating daily transactions into a monthly view of activity. This step simplifies the data, focusing on the presence of activity within each month rather than the specific dates or frequencies of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Matrix Structure**: The transformed data is arranged into a matrix format. Rows represent individual clients, identified by their account IDs. Columns correspond to monthly periods, spanning the entire range of months covered by the transaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Activity Indication**: In the matrix, a cell value is set to indicate the presence of activity for a given client in a given month. If a client made one or more transactions in a month, the corresponding cell is marked to reflect this activity. The absence of transactions for a client in a month leaves the cell unmarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Binary Representation**: The final step involves converting the activity indicators into a binary format. Active months are represented by a '1', indicating the presence of transactions, while inactive months are denoted by a '0', indicating no transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heatmap provided offers a visual representation of the activity matrix for clients, depicting the levels of engagement over various periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Diagonal Trend**: There is a distinct diagonal pattern, indicating that newer accounts (those created more recently) have fewer periods of activity. This makes sense as these accounts have not had the opportunity to transact over the earlier periods displayed on the heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Darker Areas (Purple)**: These represent periods of inactivity where clients did not engage. The darker the shade, the less activity occurred in that particular period for the corresponding set of accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Brighter Areas (Yellow)**: In contrast, the brighter areas denote periods of activity. A brighter shade implies more clients were active during that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Account Creation Date**: Clients are sorted by their account creation date. Those who joined earlier are at the top, while more recent clients appear toward the bottom of the heatmap."

This ensures that all transactions for a given account are ordered chronologically, which is crucial for accurate monthly aggregation and cumulative balance calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Monthly Grouping**: Each transaction's date is then converted to a monthly period using `dt.to_period(\"M\")`. This step categorizes each transaction by the month and year it occurred, facilitating the aggregation of transactions on a monthly basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Aggregation of Monthly Data**: The function groups the sorted transactions by `account_id` and the newly created `month` column. For each group, it calculates several metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `volume`: The sum of all transactions' amounts for the month, representing the total money flow.\n",
    "    -   `total_abs_amount`: The sum of the absolute values of the transactions' amounts, indicating the total amount of money moved, disregarding the direction.\n",
    "    -   `transaction_count`: The count of transactions, providing a sense of activity level.\n",
    "    -   `positive_transaction_count` and `negative_transaction_count`: The counts of positive (inflows) and negative (outflows) transactions, respectively. This distinction can help identify the balance between income and expenses.\n",
    "    -   Statistical measures like `average_amount`, `median_amount`, `min_amount`, `max_amount`, and `std_amount` offer insights into the distribution of transaction amounts.\n",
    "    -   `type_count`, `operation_count`, and `k_symbol_count`: The counts of unique transaction types, operations, and transaction symbols (k_symbol), respectively, indicating the diversity of transaction characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Cumulative Balance Calculation**: After aggregating the monthly data, the function computes a cumulative balance (`balance`) for each account by cumulatively summing the `volume` (total transaction amount) over time. This step provides insight into how the account balance evolves over the months.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Validation of Aggregated Data**: The `validate_monthly_aggregated_transactions` function is invoked to ensure the integrity and correctness of the aggregated data through several assertions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The balance should consistently increase or decrease based on whether the total monthly transaction volume is positive or negative, respectively.\n",
    "    -   For each account, the balance in the first month should equal the total transaction volume of that month.\n",
    "    -   The sum of positive and negative transaction counts must equal the total transaction count for each month.\n",
    "    -   The number of unique accounts in the aggregated data should match that in the original dataset.\n",
    "    -   The final balances of accounts in the aggregated data should closely match their last recorded transactions in the original dataset."
