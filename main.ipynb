By identifying when both existing cardholders and non-cardholders interacted with the bank, we can infer a level of behavioral alignment that extends beyond mere transactional data. This alignment suggests a shared response to external conditions. Intuitively we are constructing tuples of non-card holders and card holders based on the similarity of their activity patterns but one of them is not a card holder yet.\n",

        "\n",
        "To hold the needed information about every customer we create a so called activity matrix. The resolution of the activity matrix is a binary matrix where each row represents a client and each column represents a month. A value of 1 indicates activity in a given month, while 0 indicates inactivity. Therefore we concentrate on the periods during which clients engage with the bank in the form of transactions rather than the specifics of those transactions. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the construction process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Aggregation**: We start with transaction data, which records each client's interactions across various months. This data includes every transaction made by both current cardholders and non-cardholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Temporal Transformation**: Each transaction is associated with a specific date. These dates are then transformed into monthly periods, consolidating daily transactions into a monthly view of activity. This step simplifies the data, focusing on the presence of activity within each month rather than the specific dates or frequencies of transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Matrix Structure**: The transformed data is arranged into a matrix format. Rows represent individual clients, identified by their account IDs. Columns correspond to monthly periods, spanning the entire range of months covered by the transaction data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Activity Indication**: In the matrix, a cell value is set to indicate the presence of activity for a given client in a given month. If a client made one or more transactions in a month, the corresponding cell is marked to reflect this activity. The absence of transactions for a client in a month leaves the cell unmarked. Active months are represented by a '1', indicating the presence of transactions, while inactive months are denoted by a '0', indicating no transactions."

        "After matching cardholders with non-cardholders and setting artificial card issue dates, we aggregate the transactional data on a monthly basis to remove the transactional nature of the data. The monthly aggregation makes sense for multiple reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Monthly aggregation standardizes the time frame across which we analyze transactions, allowing us to compare transactional behaviors consistently across all accounts.\n",
        "- Aggregating data on a monthly level illuminates patterns that daily data might obscure. It enables us to discern trends over a broader time scale, capturing cyclical behaviors, seasonal effects, and response to macroeconomic events.\n",
        "- Daily transaction data can be \"noisy\" with random fluctuations. By considering monthly totals and averages, we reduce this noise, revealing underlying trends more clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function `aggregate_transactions_monthly` simplifies financial transactions by summarizing them every month for each account. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting Transactions**: First, the function arranges the transactions chronologically by `account_id` and `date` within the `transactions_df` DataFrame. This helps in organizing transactions for each account by date.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Monthly Grouping**: It converts each transaction's date into a monthly period. This categorizes transactions by the month and year they occurred, making it easier to group them monthly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Aggregation of Monthly Data**: The function groups these transactions by `account_id` and the `month` column. For each group, it calculates:\n",
        "   - `volume`: Total transaction amount for the month.\n",
        "   - `total_abs_amount`: Total of absolute values of all transactions, showing the total money movement regardless of direction.\n",
        "   - `transaction_count`: Number of transactions to show how active the account was.\n",
        "   - Counts of positive and negative transactions, indicating money coming in and going out.\n",
        "   - Other statistics like average, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of transaction amounts, which provide insights into how transaction amounts vary.\n",
        "   - Counts of different transaction types, operations, and symbols, showing the variety of transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Cumulative Balance Calculation**: Finally, the function calculates a running total of the `volume` to track how the account balance changes over time.\n",
        "\n",

The selected features can be retrieved from the pipeline after training.\n",
