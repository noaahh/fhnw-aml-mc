The explanation of its workings, step by step, is as follows:\n","\n","1. **Sorting Transactions**: Initially, the function sorts the transactions in the provided DataFrame `df` based on `account_id` and the transaction `date`. This ensures that all transactions for a given account are ordered chronologically, which is crucial for accurate monthly aggregation and cumulative balance calculation.\n","\n","2. **Monthly Grouping**: Each transaction's date is then converted to a monthly period using `dt.to_period(\"M\")`. This step categorizes each transaction by the month and year it occurred, facilitating the aggregation of transactions on a monthly basis.\n","\n","3. **Aggregation of Monthly Data**: The function groups the sorted transactions by `account_id` and the newly created `month` column. For each group, it calculates several metrics:\n","   - `volume`: The sum of all transactions' amounts for the month, representing the total money flow.\n","   - `total_abs_amount`: The sum of the absolute values of the transactions' amounts, indicating the total amount of money moved, disregarding the direction.\n","   - `transaction_count`: The count of transactions, providing a sense of activity level.\n","   - `positive_transaction_count` and `negative_transaction_count`: The counts of positive (inflows) and negative (outflows) transactions, respectively. This distinction can help identify the balance between income and expenses.\n","   - Statistical measures like `average_amount`, `median_amount`, `min_amount`, `max_amount`, and `std_amount` offer insights into the distribution of transaction amounts.\n","   - `type_count`, `operation_count`, and `k_symbol_count`: The counts of unique transaction types, operations, and transaction symbols (k_symbol), respectively, indicating the diversity of transaction characteristics.\n","\n","4. **Cumulative Balance Calculation**: After aggregating the monthly data, the function computes a cumulative balance (`balance`) for each account by cumulatively summing the `volume` (total transaction amount) over time. This step provides insight into how the account balance evolves over the months.\n","\n","5. **Validation of Aggregated Data**: The `validate_monthly_aggregated_transactions` function is invoked to ensure the integrity and correctness of the aggregated data through several assertions:\n","   - The balance should consistently increase or decrease based on whether the total monthly transaction volume is positive or negative, respectively.\n","   - For each account, the balance in the first month should equal the total transaction volume of that month.\n","   - The sum of positive and negative transaction counts must equal the total transaction count for each month.\n","   - The number of unique accounts in the aggregated data should match that in the original dataset.\n","   -

This ensures that subsequent operations are only performed on accounts where a card has indeed been issued.\n","\n","2. **Calculating History Length**: For each cardholder in the filtered dataset, the function calculates the history length in months from the account creation date (`account_created`) to the card issuance date (`card_issued`). This calculation helps in identifying the duration for which the account has been active before a card was issued.\n","\n","3. **Identifying Eligible Cardholders**: The function then filters out cardholders based on a minimum history length criterion, specified by `min_history_months`. Only cardholders who have an account history equal to or longer than this threshold are considered eligible for further analysis.\n","\n","4. **Merging Transaction Data**: The eligible cardholders' information is merged with monthly transaction data based on `account_id`. This step associates each transaction with the corresponding cardholder's account information, preparing the data for detailed transaction analysis.\n","\n","5. **Assigning Card Issuance Date to Transactions**: For each transaction in the merged dataset, the function assigns the card issuance date from the cardholder's information. This is crucial for calculating the period before card issuance during which the transactions occurred.\n","\n","6. **Filtering Transactions Before Card Issuance**: Transactions are filtered based on the number of months before card issuance, defined by the `months_before_card_range` parameter. This step ensures that only transactions occurring within the specified period before card issuance are considered for aggregation.\n","\n","7. **Aggregating Transactions**: The function aggregates the filtered transactions by `account_id` and the number of months before card issuance. Aggregation metrics include sum, mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for various transaction attributes like volume, absolute amount, transaction counts, and balance. This aggregation provides a comprehensive overview of spending patterns.\n","\n","8. **Pivoting Aggregated Data**: The aggregated transaction data is pivoted to create a wide-format DataFrame where each row represents an account, and columns represent aggregated transaction metrics for different months before card issuance. This format is useful for analyzing trends over time leading up to card issuance.\n","\n","9. **Final Dataset Preparation**: Finally, the function resets the index of the pivoted DataFrame, ensuring that `account_id` is a column in the final dataset, which makes it easier to identify each account's aggregated transaction metrics."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"80a069cd9f414ca58fb86765590a29b3","deepnote_app_block_visible":true,"deepnote_app_is_code_hidden":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":3397,"execution_start":1711107675127,"source_hash":null},"outputs":[],"source":["def pivot_transactions(non_transactional_df, transactions_monthly_df, months_before_card_range=(2, 13)):\n","    merged_df = transactions_monthly_df.merge(non_transactional_df[['account_id']], on='account_id')\n","\n","    merged_df['card_issued_date'] = merged_df['account_id'].map(non_transactional_df.set_index('account_id')['card_issued'])\n","    merged_df['months_before_card'] = merged_df.apply(lambda row: (row['card_issued_date'].to_period('M') -
